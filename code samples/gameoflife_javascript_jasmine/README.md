1) open index.html in browser to open the app and see all four worlds and and next generation of each world in the game 
2) there are tests in SpecRunner.html written only for world 1. we can write for the rest three worlds in  a similar fashion 
3) each input given in the question is a world according to me 
4) just open SpecRunner.html in browser to see the tests running. 8 tests need to pass.
